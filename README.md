# PySCF-ASE Interface Project

In this ongoing project, PySCF (Python-based Simulations Chemistry Framework) will interface with ASE (Atomic Simulation Environment) in order to perform electronic structure calculations. This includes density functional theory approximation technique to find the Hamiltonian of a many-body quantum system.
